It’s built with love, patience, and a lot of tiny details.

## A Small Note
 This is my **very first frontend project**.

I'm sill learning and dont know everything yet about frontend developement, but this prject was my first real hands-on experince with building a UI, working with animations, layouts, and interactions.

It means a lot me, personally and both emotionally. It totally meant for her💌.
